# python-visualization
Encountering this topic, my first thought is to see if I can turn the salary data in the Baltimore Fire Department into python visualization. I choose the total salary, the counts of the department and the average salary as my analysis objects. And the results are shown in the line graph, pie chart and animated bar.<br>

[Animated bar](https://github.com/hynz233/python-visualization/blob/master/bar.png)<br>
The results show that BFD is becoming larger and would have to spend more and more money every year.
